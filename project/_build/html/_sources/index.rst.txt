   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Confluence 2 Sphinx's documentation!
================================================

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1
   :caption: Table of Contents
   :glob:
   :includehidden:

   *
..
   Notes:
   maxdepth is used to indicates the depth of the tree.
   numbered adds relevant section numbers.
   titlesonly adds only the main title of each document
   glob can be used to indicate that * and ? characters are used to indicate patterns.
   hidden hides the toctree. It can be used to include files that do not need to be shown (e.g. a bibliography).
