## Confluence Page Properties feature in Sphinx

### Status

* Concept is WIP.
* This repo is meant to:
  * follow the progress of the idea as I stumble along experiments.
  * share the progress with interested collaborators.

### Introduction

* Page Properties & Page Properties Report are THE power feature in Confluence, it's a bit like AirTables *lite*.
* Some use cases I use PP & PPR extensively for:
  * Vendor Inventory
  * Service Inventory
  * Policies/Standards/Procedures
  * Project Tracking

### Experience being replicated

* For simplicity sake:
  * One Parent page that will be used to summarize data from Children pages in a table, ie. Page Properties Report.
  * The data being summarized is a key-value pair added to each Child page, ie. Page Properties.
  * The selection of which pages to include in the PPR is one or more page Labels.

### Features to replicate

* Page Properties
  * key-value pairs added to each child page
* Page Labels
  * This allows filtering which pages include in report.
* Page Properties Report
  * Mechanism to display in a table format, the key-value pairs of the filtered child pages.
